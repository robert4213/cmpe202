# Decorator Pattern
In this lab I choose decorator pattern as my target. I use lambda expression to refactor the pattern.   
# Result
![Decorator pattern with Lambda expression](https://github.com/robert4213/cmpe202/blob/master/lab9/decorator_lambda/2019-04-07_211723.png)    
We can see with lambda expression, the code becomes much shorter than before. I get rid of 4 classes, and only use 1 interface and 1 test class to realize this pattern.
